# Emotion Detection and Intensity Analysis ü§ñüîç
This project addresses the challenges of analyzing text due to human limitations in detecting emotions within digital sentences. To overcome this, we developed an AI-based Emotion and Intensity Detector designed to identify and classify emotions present in text. The system is capable of predicting and measuring emotion intensity, as well as classifying emotions using lexicons and datasets that were utilized to train the model, providing a more accurate and efficient solution for emotion detection in textual data. This project proposes an analysis of two model types for text-based emotion analysis: a Regression Model and a Classification Model. The Regression Model is designed to predict the intensity of an emotion within a text, analyzing the Ridge, LightGBMRegressor, and Ensemble algorithms. The Classification Model is built to classify the specific type of emotion present, comparing the performance of Logistic Regression, LightGBMClassifier, SVM, and Ensemble algorithms.
